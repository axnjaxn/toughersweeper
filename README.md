Toughersweeper
============

Toughersweeper improves upon toughsweeper in a number of ways:

1. Switched away from my old undergrad code habits
2. Switched to the SDL2-powered libbyteimage
3. Different game rules (still to do)

You can use the mouse to mine or flag, and number keys to mark for later. F2 will start a new game.
